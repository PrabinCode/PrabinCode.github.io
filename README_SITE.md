# Personal portfolio — setup & project suggestions

This repository now contains a simple static portfolio site you can host on GitHub Pages.

Files added
- `/index.html` — single-page portfolio template
- `/assets/styles.css` — minimal responsive styles

Quick edits
- Edit `/data/profile.json` to add your `name`, `tagline`, `bio`, `email`, `linkedin`, `github`, and `projects`.
- Projects are an array of objects with `title`, `description`, and optional `link`.

Publish to GitHub Pages
1. Commit and push to the `master` branch (this repo is already a `username.github.io` site).
2. GitHub Pages will serve `index.html` automatically from `master` for user sites.

Project ideas (pick 2–4 to showcase different skills)
- Personal blog with static site generator (Jekyll, Hugo) — shows writing and content skills.
- Full-stack task manager (React + Node/Express + PostgreSQL) — demonstrates CRUD, auth, DB.
- Data visualization dashboard (D3 / Plotly) using public datasets — shows data skills.
- CLI developer tool or npm package — reusable code and tests, publish to npm.
- Open-source contribution fork + PR walkthrough — show process, tests, and maintainability.
- AI-assisted resume reviewer (small web app) — integrates an LLM or heuristic rules.

Which to choose
- If you're early-career: pick a polished full-stack app + one visualization or blog post.
- If you want to impress recruiters: build a real-world feature (auth, tests, CI) and host a demo.
- If you want quick wins: a static blog and a small interactive data viz can be completed fast.

Next steps I can take
- Replace placeholders with your LinkedIn bio, photo, and email.
- Add project pages and live demos, or convert this to a React/Vite site.
- Create CI to auto-deploy on push.

Tell me which content (bio, projects, email) you want me to add and I will update the site.
